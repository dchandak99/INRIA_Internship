# INRIA_Internship

### Formal Verification of Security Protocols | Cryptography
I was a Research Intern at INRIA Nancy during April and May 2020, under Professors Steve Kremer and Jannik Dreier.

**Highlights:**
- Studied operational semantics and equivalence properties (in *applied pi calculus* and **Tamarin** prover), the current translation of **SAPIC**(tool translating high level protocols to multiset rewrite rules, analyzable by Tamarin)
- Introduced biprocesses (*with bisemantics and their translation*), static equivalence and diff equivalence (*& diff operator*) in SAPIC, ensuring the soundness of the translation after the addition
